# Day 14: Atomic Model & Solar System Simulations 🌌  

Welcome to **Day 14** of my #30DayCodingChallenge! 🎉 Today, I built **two interactive simulations** using **Pygame**—one representing an **atomic model** and the other a **solar system**. Both projects visually simulate motion based on real-world concepts, featuring dynamic particle movement, user interaction, and real-time statistics.

## 🚀 Project 1: Atomic Model Simulation  

### 🔬 Overview  
This simulation represents an atomic model where electrons orbit around a nucleus, inspired by **Bohr’s Model of the Atom**. Users can dynamically **add or remove electrons**, observe their movement, and **pause/play** the simulation.  

### ✨ Features  
✅ **Electron Motion**: Electrons revolve around the nucleus at different radii and speeds.  
✅ **Dynamic Electron Management**: Users can add or remove electrons.  
✅ **Pause/Play Functionality**: Freeze and resume electron motion at will.  
✅ **Real-Time Statistics**: Displays the current number of electrons and their average orbital radius.  

### 🎮 Controls  
- **Add Electron**: Click the "Add Electron" button.  
- **Remove Electron**: Click the "Remove Electron" button.  
- **Pause/Play**: Click the "Pause/Play" button to freeze/unfreeze electron movement.

## 🌍 Project 2: Solar System Simulation  

### ☀️ Overview  
This simulation models a **simplified solar system**, where planets orbit around the Sun due to gravitational attraction. The physics behind it follows **Newton’s Laws of Motion** and the **Inverse Square Law** of gravitation.  

### ✨ Features  
✅ **Gravity-Based Motion**: Planets orbit the Sun with velocity adjustments based on gravitational pull.  
✅ **Dynamic Planet Management**: Users can add or remove planets.  
✅ **Orbit Tracing**: Each planet leaves a trail representing its past movement.  
✅ **Pause/Play Functionality**: Freeze and resume planetary motion at any time.  
✅ **Real-Time Statistics**: Displays mass details of each planet.  

### 🎮 Controls  
- **Add Planet**: Click the "Add Planet" button.  
- **Remove Planet**: Click the "Remove Planet" button.  
- **Pause/Play**: Click the "Pause/Play" button to freeze/unfreeze planetary motion.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pygame** (for graphics and simulation)  
- **Math** (for orbital physics and trigonometry)  
- **Randomization** (for procedural electron and planet generation)

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
- **Visual simulations** are a great way to learn about physics and motion.  
- **Pygame** is an excellent tool for creating interactive simulations.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** helps structure complex behaviors like orbital motion.

## 🎯 Next Steps  
- Improve **UI design** with better aesthetics and animations.  
- Implement **collision detection** for more realistic simulations.  
- Add **customization options** like different atomic structures and planetary systems.
